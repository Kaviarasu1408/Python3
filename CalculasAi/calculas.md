## 1. Calculas

- using calculas we can check small changes in the input(weight) affect the output(error/loss).

## Key Concepts

Model predicates

- **Derivatives** : Derivatives will tell the loss and we changes the direction to reduce the loss.

- **Gradients** : How to move when we have multiple inputs.

- **Gradients Descent** : Try, check the errors and repeat untill the loss is small.

- **Chain Rule** : chain rule will tell us how a change in one input affects the final output.It chains through multiple chains between

- **Parital Derivatives** : change in one variables and tell how the output changes.

- **Backpropagation** : After every loss check for the errors..analyse and learn from the errors.After each round the loss will be closers..It works in the backwards..
