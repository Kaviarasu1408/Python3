## 1. Descriptive Statistics

- Mean, Median and Mode.

## 2. Probability Theory

- Let say if a coin is tossed. what is the probabilty it lands on head.(50-50)
- **Independent Events :** Two events are independent if the outcome doesn't affet the outcome of others.
- **Dependent Events :** Two events are dependent if the outcome  affet the outcome of others.

## 3. Random Variables

- It helps with different outcome.
- **Discrete Distributions** : countable outcomes.
- **Continuous Distributions** : inifinte outcomes.


## 4. Expectations, Variance, SD.

- Expectations
- Variance
- Standard deviation

## 5. Probabilty Distribution

- Binomial, Poission
- Uniform, Normal, Exponentail.

## 6. Central Limit Theorem

- Sample means of any population will tend toward a normal distribution as a sample size increase.

## 7. Bayes Theorem

- It help us to reverse the possibilites after seeing the evidence..

## 8. Hypothesis Testing.

- Null or Alternative Hypothesis.
- p-value, confidence intervals, z-test, t-test.

## 9. Coorelation and Covariance

- These helps us to understand the realtionship between variables.
- **Covariance** : Covariance tells us how two variables vary together.
- **Correlation** : Correlation standardizes covariance to a range of [-1,1]
