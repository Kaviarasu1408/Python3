## 1. Descriptive Statistics

List = [3,7,7,2,9]

- **Mean :** is a average value which sum/count 28/5 = 5.6
- **Median :** Middle Number = 7.
- **Mode :** Most frequent value = 7.
- **Range :** Max=9, Min =2., Max - Min = 9-2 = 7.
- **Variance :** subtract the mean from each number, then square the result.
- **Standard deviation:** square root of variance.
- **Quartiles :** Divide your data into 4 equal parts.
- **Percentiles :** Divide the data into 100 equal parts. 
- **Skeweness :** It tells how symmetric our data is.Skewness= 0 [perfect symmetrical], Positive Skew[Tail longer right side], Negative Skew[Tail longer left side].E.g data = [1,2,3,4,5,10] - Right Skew - one big value at the end

## 2. Probability Theory

- Let say if a coin is tossed. what is the probabilty it lands on head.(50-50)
- **Independent Events :** Two events are independent if the outcome doesn't affet the outcome of others.
- **Dependent Events :** Two events are dependent if the outcome  affet the outcome of others.

## 3. Random Variables

- It helps with different outcome.
- **Discrete Distributions** : countable outcomes.
- **Continuous Distributions** : inifinte outcomes.


## 4. Probabilty Distribution

- Binomial, Poission
- Uniform, Normal, Exponentail.

## 5. Central Limit Theorem

- From the population we will take few samples we can calculate the the mean..repeat the process.And now have records of mean..plot it on the histogram..it looks like bell shaped.

## 6. Bayes Theorem

- It help us to update the probabilty after we get the new information.
- Let say 20% email are spam: p(spam) = 0.2
- 80% email are not spam: p(No spam) = 0.8
- The word free appears in 60 % of spam email: p(free | span)= 0.6
- The word free appears in 5 % of non spam email: p(free | not span) = 0.05
- Question : you are recieve an email contains word free.what is the probability that email is span.

## 7. Hypothesis Testing.

- **Null Hypothesis :** Null Hypothesis is like there is no change or difference.E.g Math App does not improve the student test scores.
- **Alternative Hypothesis :** Alternative Hypothesis is like there is change and difference.E.g Math does improve the student test scores.
- **p-value :** If the p-value lesser than 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis(H0) and the app has some effect. if the p value is greater than 0.05 fail to reject H0.E.g H0 app has no effect and app has some effect
- **Z-Test :** When the standard deviation is known, sample size is greater than 30.

- **T-Test :** when the standard deviation is not known, sample size is lesser than 30.

- **Confidence Interval :** Confidence Interval is like it gives the percentage. for eg: suppose the average height of 100 men is 170 cm. A 95% Confidence interval says.


## 8. Coorelation and Covariance

- These helps us to understand the realtionship between variables.
- **Covariance** : Covariance tells us how two variables vary together.
- **Correlation** : Correlation standardizes covariance to a range of [-1,1]
